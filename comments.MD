- The commits must be descriptive. Please indicate the main reason as to why you are making a change, Something like "Updated the routes to include reset password endpoints", not "added files"

- And the endpoints to reset and forget password

- As a user, I want to be able to fetch only the notes that I created/own. Your index method fetches all the notes

- Categorize and Prioritize your items, Add Category Model and Priority Model. Provide the Crud functionality for these two

- Write tests for your implementation
